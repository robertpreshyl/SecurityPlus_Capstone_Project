## Phase Introduction

Welcome to Phase 5, the culminating phase of your Security+ capstone project. While previous phases focused on technical controls and operations, this phase elevates your perspective to the strategic level—where security becomes an organizational discipline rather than just a technical function.

**Why This Phase Matters:**

Security technology means nothing without governance to direct it, risk management to prioritize it, compliance to validate it, and people who understand and support it. The most sophisticated SIEM is useless if there's no policy defining what to monitor. The best vulnerability scanner means nothing if there's no process to act on findings. This phase teaches you to build the management framework that makes technical security effective.

**Real-World Context:**

As a security analyst, you will:
- Write and maintain security policies
- Conduct and document risk assessments
- Evaluate third-party vendors for security risk
- Prepare for and support compliance audits
- Develop security awareness training for employees

This phase transforms you from "the person who runs security tools" to "the person who builds security programs."

---

## Scenario Context: NordicShield's Maturity Journey

### Story Continuation

With the SOC operational (Phase 4), NordicShield's leadership wants to mature the security program. The company is preparing for:
- **ISO 27001 certification** (required by major customers)
- **SOC 2 Type II audit** (for SaaS product customers)
- **GDPR compliance validation** (regulatory requirement)
- **Expansion into US market** (new regulatory considerations)

The board has asked: *"How do we know our security investment is working? How do we demonstrate due diligence to customers, regulators, and partners?"*

### Your Role

You are now acting as the **Security Program Manager** working alongside the CISO to:
- Formalize the security governance framework
- Implement enterprise risk management for security
- Establish vendor security assessment processes
- Prepare for upcoming audits and certifications
- Build a security-aware culture across the organization

### Budget & Resources
