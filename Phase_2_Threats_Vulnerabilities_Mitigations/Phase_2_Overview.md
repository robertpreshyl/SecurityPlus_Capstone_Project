# Phase 2: Threats, Vulnerabilities, and Mitigations
## NordicShield Technologies Oy | Security+ Capstone Project

---

## Phase Overview

Phase 2 addresses the largest domain of the Security+ SY0-701 exam at **22%**. You will analyze threats targeting NordicShield Technologies, assess vulnerabilities across the enterprise, investigate realistic security incidents, and design mitigation strategies.

**Real-World Context:** NordicShield has recently detected suspicious activity targeting their IoT infrastructure. Intelligence suggests a threat actor group known as **"Arctic Fox"** (fictional) has been conducting reconnaissance against Nordic green-tech companies. Your role as Junior Security Analyst is to assess the threat landscape, identify vulnerabilities, analyze indicators of compromise, and recommend mitigations.

## Scenario Brief: The Arctic Fox Campaign

### Intelligence Summary

```
CLASSIFICATION: INTERNAL USE ONLY
DATE: [Current Date]
SOURCE: Finnish National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-FI)

THREAT ADVISORY: ARCTIC FOX CAMPAIGN

The NCSC-FI has issued an advisory regarding a sophisticated threat campaign 
targeting Finnish technology companies in the green-tech and data center sectors.

KEY POINTS:
- Threat actor: "Arctic Fox" (State-sponsored, suspected nation-state origin)
- Targets: IoT manufacturers, data center operators, cooling technology firms
- TTPs: Spear-phishing, supply chain compromise, IoT exploitation
- Objectives: Intellectual property theft, persistent access, potential disruption

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
- Review IoT device security
- Audit third-party vendor access
- Monitor for indicators of compromise (IOCs provided)
- Report suspicious activity to NCSC-FI
```

### NordicShield Relevance

This threat is directly relevant to NordicShield because:
1. NordicShield is a Finnish green-tech company (matches targeting profile)
2. Company has valuable intellectual property (proprietary cooling algorithms)
3. Large IoT deployment creates substantial attack surface
4. Global expansion increases exposure
5. Supply chain includes multiple third-party components
