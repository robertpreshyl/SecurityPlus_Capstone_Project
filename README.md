# Security+ Capstone Project - NordicShield Security Assessment

A hands-on security assessment project for a fictional company, demonstrating the skills I learned while preparing for CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701). This is my way of applying what I studied instead of just memorizing exam dumps.

## Why I Built This

After passing my Security+ exam (789/900, January 2026), I wanted to create a comprehensive capstone project that covers all five Security+ domains in one place. This isn't just for my portfolio - its a knowledge roadmap I can always come back to when I need to visualize how enterprise security actually works.

Reading about incident response playbooks is one thing. Actually writing one, mapping it to NIST 800-61, and thinking through real scenarios? Completley different. I learn better when I can see the full picture, not just isolated concepts.

So I created NordicShield Technologies, a fictional Finnish company with realistic security challenges, and worked through building their entire security program from the ground up. Now when I think about "security operations" or "risk management," I can instantly picture the NordicShield scenario and walk through the steps in my mind.

This project is my mental model for enterprise security. If you find it helpful, feel free to star it ⭐

## The Scenario

**NordicShield Technologies Oy** is a 120-person company in Helsinki that makes sustainable cooling solutions for data centers. They just raised €15M Series B and are expanding to Amsterdam, Austin, and Kigali. 

The problem? Their security is... not great:
- No formal policies (everything is "we'll figure it out")
- No SIEM - they're basically flying blind
- MFA is inconsistent at best
- No incident response plan
- Basic firewall, thats it

Sound familiar? Most SMEs look like this. My job was to fix it.

## What's In Here

The project follows the 5 Security+ exam domains:

### Phase 1: General Security Concepts (12%)
- Security controls matrix
- CIA triad implementation  
- Authentication strategy
- Gap analysis
- Zero trust assessment

### Phase 2: Threats & Vulnerabilities (22%)
- Threat actor profiling
- Vulnerability assessment
- Social engineering defenses
- Malware analysis procedures
- Attack surface mapping

### Phase 3: Security Architecture (18%)
- Network segmentation design
- Cloud security architecture
- IAM implementation
- Encryption strategy
- Resilience planning

### Phase 4: Security Operations (28%)
- SIEM implementation plan
- Vulnerability management program
- Log analysis procedures
- Incident response plan & playbooks
- Digital forensics procedures
- Automation scripts

### Phase 5: Program Management (20%)
- Security policy framework
- Risk management program
- Compliance mapping (GDPR, NIS2, ISO 27001)
- Security awareness training
- Vendor risk assessment
- Business continuity plan

## How to Use This

If your studying for Security+ or want to see how these concepts apply to a real scenario:

1. Start with `01_Company_Documentation/NordicShield_Complete_Profile.md` to understand the company
2. Go through each phase in order
3. Each deliverable shows practical application of exam objectives

Feel free to fork this and adapt it for your own learning. Just dont copy paste it as your own work - do the thinking yourself, thats where the learning happens.
